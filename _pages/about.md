I am a human geneticist working in Changping Laboratory, Beijing. 

I focus on linking diseases and phenotypes to their genetic causes using data from large cohorts.

Alongside my academic work, I also pursue my interests in science journalism and photography on a part-time basis.

Ars longa, vita brevis.
