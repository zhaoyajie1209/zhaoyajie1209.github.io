      institution: MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge
      year: 2022 - 2025
      description:
        - "This post plans to utilise such data in the UK Biobank study to identify rare, protein-coding, genetic variants associated with obesity to highlight novel genes and biological mechanisms. This work will involve developing new computational pipelines and methods to perform quality control and analysis on billions of data points in half a million study participants. Genes highlighted by these analyses will then be shared with experimental collaborators, both internally in Cambridge and externally, to gain further mechanistic insight in animal and cellular models."

      items: 
        - "Mosaic loss of the X/Y chromosome (mLOX/Y) is the most common form of somatic mosaicism for females and males, respectively. The genetic causes and phenotypic consequences of these events are still unclear. I have developed a formula to combine different mosaic loss of the X/Y chromosome(mLOX/Y) measurement based on SNP-array and high throughput sequencing data and applied it on large trans-ethnic cohorts to reveal the genetic architecture of mLOX/Y through GWAS and Exome-wide burden analysis. Using this approach, I have found genes associated with mLOX/Y. Disruption of these genes can substantially increase the risk to have mLOY and my future work will combine dry lab work and wet lab work to investigate the mechanism behind mLOX/Y."
    - title: "How rare variants affect human traits."
      items:
        - "The decreased cost of sequencing and its application to large research cohorts provide a chance to systematically explore how rare coding variants affect human traits. I have designed, implemented, and utilised software to identify genetic associations in a cohort of 200K humans from the UK Biobank study. I am interested in applying these tools to larger and more diverse populations to identify gene-phenotype associations and develop these findings into novel therapeutic targets."
