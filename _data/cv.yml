      description:
        - Utilising such data in the UK Biobank study to identify rare, protein-coding, genetic variants associated with obesity to highlight novel genes and biological mechanisms.
        - Developing new computational pipelines and methods to perform quality control and analysis on billions of data points in half a million study participants.
        - Genes highlighted by these analyses will then be shared with experimental collaborators, both internally in Cambridge and externally, to gain further mechanistic insight in animal and cellular models.
