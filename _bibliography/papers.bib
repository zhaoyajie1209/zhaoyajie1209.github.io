	abstract = {Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in leukocytes is the most common form of clonal mosaicism, caused by dysregulation in cell-cycle and DNA damage response pathways. Previous genetic studies have focussed on identifying common variants associated with LOY, which we now extend to rarer, protein-coding variation using exome sequences from 82,277 male UK Biobank participants. We find that loss of function of two genes—CHEK2 and GIGYF1—reach exome-wide significance. Rare alleles in GIGYF1 have not previously been implicated in any complex trait, but here loss-of-function carriers exhibit six-fold higher susceptibility to LOY (OR = 5.99 [3.04–11.81], p = 1.3 × 10−10). These same alleles are also associated with adverse metabolic health, including higher susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes (OR = 6.10 [3.51–10.61], p = 1.8 × 10−12), 4 kg higher fat mass (p = 1.3 × 10−4), 2.32 nmol/L lower serum IGF1 levels (p = 1.5 × 10−4) and 4.5 kg lower handgrip strength (p = 4.7 × 10−7) consistent with proposed GIGYF1 enhancement of insulin and IGF-1 receptor signalling. These associations are mirrored by a common variant nearby associated with the expression of GIGYF1. Our observations highlight a potential direct connection between clonal mosaicism and metabolic health.},

              Context
              Biological and translational insights from large-scale, array-based genetic studies of fat distribution, a key determinant of metabolic health, have been limited by the difficulty in linking predominantly noncoding variants to specific gene targets. Rare coding variant analyses provide greater confidence that a specific gene is involved, but do not necessarily indicate whether gain or loss of function (LoF) would be of most therapeutic benefit.
            
            
              Objective
              This work aimed to identify genes/proteins involved in determining fat distribution.
            
            
              Methods
              We combined the power of genome-wide analysis of array-based rare, nonsynonymous variants in 450 562 individuals in the UK Biobank with exome-sequence-based rare LoF gene burden testing in 184 246 individuals.
            
            
              Results
              The data indicate that the LoF of 4 genes (PLIN1 [LoF variants, P = 5.86 × 10–7], INSR [LoF variants, P = 6.21 × 10–7], ACVR1C [LoF + moderate impact variants, P = 1.68 × 10–7; moderate impact variants, P = 4.57 × 10–7], and PDE3B [LoF variants, P = 1.41 × 10–6]) is associated with a beneficial effect on body mass index–adjusted waist-to-hip ratio and increased gluteofemoral fat mass, whereas LoF of PLIN4 (LoF variants, P = 5.86 × 10–7 adversely affects these parameters. Phenotypic follow-up suggests that LoF of PLIN1, PDE3B, and ACVR1C favorably affects metabolic phenotypes (eg, triglycerides [TGs] and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol concentrations) and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, whereas PLIN4 LoF has adverse health consequences. INSR LoF is associated with lower TG and HDL levels but may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study robustly implicates these genes in the regulation of fat distribution, providing new and in some cases somewhat counterintuitive insight into the potential consequences of targeting these molecules therapeutically.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) – age-related expansion of mutated hematopoietic clones – can differ in frequency and cellular fitness. Descriptive studies have identified a spectrum of events (coding mutations in driver genes (CHIP), gains/losses and copy-neutral loss of chromosomal segments (mCAs), and loss of sex chromosomes). Co-existence of different CH events raises key questions as to their origin, selection, and impact. Here, we report analyses of sequence and genotype array data in up to 482,378 individuals from UK Biobank, demonstrating shared genetic architecture across different types of CH. These data highlighted evidence for a cellular evolutionary trade-off between different forms of CH, with LOY occurring at lower rates in individuals carrying mutations in established CHIP genes. Furthermore, we observed co-occurrence of CHIP and mCAs with overlap at
            TET2, DNMT3A
            , and
            JAK2
            , in which CHIP precedes mCA acquisition. Individuals carrying these overlapping somatic mutations had a large increase in risk of future hematological malignancy (HR=17.31, 95\% CI=9.80-30.58, P=8.94×10
            −23
            ), which is significantly elevated compared to individuals with non-overlapping CHIP and autosomal mCAs (P
            heterogeneity
            =8.83×10
            −3
            ). Finally, we leverage the shared genetic architecture of these CH traits to identify 15 novel loci associated with blood cancer risk.},

	abstract = {Mosaic loss of the X chromosome (mLOX) is the most commonly occurring clonal somatic alteration detected in the leukocytes of women, yet little is known about its genetic determinants or phenotypic consequences. To address this, we estimated mLOX in {\textgreater}900,000 women across eight biobanks, identifying 10\% of women with detectable X loss in approximately 2\% of their leukocytes. Out of 1,253 diseases examined, women with mLOX had an elevated risk of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias and pneumonia. Genetic analyses identified 49 common variants influencing mLOX, implicating genes with established roles in chromosomal missegregation, cancer predisposition, and autoimmune diseases. Complementary exome-sequence analyses identified rare missense variants in
            FBXO10
            which confer a two-fold increased risk of mLOX. A small fraction of these associations were shared with mosaic Y chromosome loss in men, suggesting different biological processes drive the formation and clonal expansion of sex chromosome missegregation events. Allelic shift analyses identified alleles on the X chromosome which are preferentially retained, demonstrating that variation at many loci across the X chromosome is under cellular selection. A novel polygenic score including 44 independent X chromosome allelic shift loci correctly inferred the retained X chromosomes in 80.7\% of mLOX cases in the top decile. Collectively our results support a model where germline variants predispose women to acquiring mLOX, with the allelic content of the X chromosome possibly shaping the magnitude of subsequent clonal expansion.},

	abstract = {Obesity is a major risk factor for many common diseases and has a significant heritable component. While clinical and large-scale population studies have identified several genes harbouring rare alleles with large effects on obesity risk, there are likely many unknown genes with highly penetrant effects remaining. To this end, we performed whole exome-sequence analyses for adult body mass index (BMI) in up to 587,027 individuals. We identified rare, loss of function variants in two genes - BSN and APBA1 - with effects on BMI substantially larger than well-established obesity genes such as MC4R. One in {\textasciitilde}6500 individuals carry a heterozygous protein truncating variant (PTV) in BSN, which confers a 6.6, 3.7 and 3-fold higher risk of severe obesity (BMI {\textgreater}40kg/m2), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes, respectively. In contrast to most other obesity-related genes, rare variants in BSN and APBA1 had no apparent effect on childhood adiposity. Furthermore, BSN PTVs magnified the influence of common genetic variants associated with BMI, with a common polygenic score exhibiting an effect on BMI twice as large in BSN PTV carriers than non-carriers. Finally, we explored the plasma proteomic signatures of BSN PTV carriers as well as the functional consequences of BSN deletion in human iPSC-derived hypothalamic neurons. These approaches highlighted a network of differentially expressed genes that were collectively enriched for genomic regions associated with BMI, and suggest a role for degenerative neuronal synaptic function and neurotransmitter release in the etiology of obesity.},
